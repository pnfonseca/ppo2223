Please note that these are *solution proposals* for the problems proposed in the *hands-on* classes of 41519-Object Oriented Programming ("Programação por Objetos"). They are not perfect and they certainly contain errors and flaws. They are made available as an example of *possible* solutions for the problems and as a way for you, as a student, to be able to find the way to solve a problem, in case you are stuck at some point. Do not just download this code and run it. Try to understand the solution, the strategy and the approach used. Learn from it, if possible, and then try to transpose this learning to *your solution*. Solutions should go *from the repository* into your *code*, but going *trough your brain* (and ***never*** *bypassing* your brain!)
